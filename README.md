# Roman Upscope Visioning Science Cases

## Sky Viewer

* [“Look for my favorite object and inspect it (all in MAST)”](sky-viewer-base.md)
* [“Find an object observed by Roman and identify other MAST data overlapping with it (+accessing catalogs via astroquery in platform)”](sky-viewer-other-data.md)
* [“Do catalog searches in the platform, show them on the sky in Roman, do various data-mining tasks”](sky-viewer-catalog-search.md)

## Image Viewer

* [“Sky-to-image transition:identify features only visible with careful stretching“](image-viewer-base.md)
* [“Go from sky-viewer to single-exposures to determine if a specific object is an artifact or not, including ramp view”](image-viewer-ramp-view.md)
* ["Do aperture photometry from the platform on a specific Roman image subset”](image-viewer-aperture-photometry.md)
* [“Do PSF photometry from the platform on a specific Roman image subset“](image-viewer-psf-photometry.md)
* ["Imviz <-> Catlog Interactions"](imviz-catalog.md)

## Platform Database Access

* ["Starting from zero, gain some basic knowledge of what’s in a Roman source catalog, for someone who doesn’t know much about the mission."](database-access-base.md)
* [“Start with some reasonable/common queries in the platform, then realize you need something esoteric"](database-access-extended.md)
* [“Cross-match a subset of a Roman catalog with a catalog that is also in some random part of AWS that is sizable but not big enough to need batch processing.“](database-access-xmatch.md)
* ["Time series focused Roman queries"](time-series-roman.md)
* [“Write a dynamic query that the user specifies in galactic coordinates that then auto-translates to what the catalog sees (Stretch Goal)“](database-access-dynamic.md)

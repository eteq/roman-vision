    "This use case demonstrates how a scientist user can go from a sky view of Roman observations to an interactive view of slitless spectra taken by Roman. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prof. Sanzang is an experienced astronomer who has long been on a career-long quest searching for a class of galaxies he calls Sutras, which are rare compact objects with unusual spectra predicted to be near much more easily identified galaxies known as Vultures.  He learns from a conference in Chang'an about how Roman will be targeting some extragalactic fields with many Vultures in them and realizes the Roman slitless spectra may be perfect for identifying Sutras. At the conference, Sanzang meets an experienced research scientist, Sun Wukong, who has been seeking to atone for a previous failure attempting to take over a collaboration doing slitless spectroscopy with JWST. Wukong, being very clever but also impulsive, decides the Roman Research Nexus is the way to do this even though no one in the team has any experience with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wukong quickly figures out how to start up the RRN and get the Aladin Lite skyviewer pointed at the target field with all the Vultures (see the other sky viewer cases for a examples of how he might have learned this). Knowing that the only way to identify Sutras are via spectroscopic data, he wants to see all the objects in the field with extracted Roman slitless spectra, and wants to inspect a subset that might be a Sutra. There are two ways Wukong might want to do this, so below we consider both cases: the \"UI-based\" approach and the \"Astroquery approach\".\n",

    "In this case, Wukong works entirely with interactive visualization tools to find the spectrum he wants to examine.\n",
    "\n",
    "He first needs a way to show the objects that the roman pipeline extracted as having spectra. There are several equally-valid ways this could work, but the most straightforward way is for there to be a toggle in the default RRN instance of Aladin Lite that just turns on marking all the extracted locations.  These would then appear as circles marking the relevant sources locations based on where the 0th order flux should be.  Using that, Wukong identifies a source that on the Aladin Lite sky view looks like it could be a Sutra and also has a spectrum.  Clicking on that then brings up a tooltip, side panel, or similar UI element that shows some details about that source, akin to the same information that the MAST portal would show about that specific target. Wukong would have a quick glance at that information to identify whether the object has the right properties to be a Sutra candidate.  He has to click on several objects before finding one that looks right, but once he finds it, he clicks on the \"launch in Specviz\" button that appears on the UI panel.  That triggers a new panel to appear in the RRN web interface that shows specviz pre-loaded with the specific target (analogous to what currently happens when you click a jdaviz-tool icon in the MAST portal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the specviz view has appeared, Wukong quickly examines the spectrum and decides if it looks like the spectrum is roughly right for a Sutra. He'll have to look at several spectra to see a good one, so it should be easy to click on a new target and have specviz be update to show the new spectrum.  But once a good spectrum is found, Wukong clicks on a button something like \"open in notebook\", which opens up a Jupyter notebook that has as the first couple of cells exactly what is needed to launch specviz on the view Wukong has already been looking at.  This allows Wukong to continue with the workflow in the section below \"The cases recombine\"."
